// Create a new book schema for our database.
// The schema defines the shape of documents in a collection.
// In this case, a book will have a name property of type String.
// The name property is required, which means that every book document must have a name.
// Same goes for the author and publishYear properties, only the publishYear property is of type Number.
// timestamps: true adds createdAt and updatedAt properties to the book document.
// createdAt is the date and time when the book document was created.
// updatedAt is the date and time when the book document was last updated.
// These properties are useful for debugging purposes.
// For example, if a book document was created a long time ago and it has not been updated since,
// then it is probably safe to delete it.
// If a book document was created a long time ago and it has been updated recently,
// then it is probably still in use and should not be deleted.
// The timestamps option is not required, but it is useful.

// TODO: [MERNSTACK-10] Solve Codacy issue that ticketnumber is not used.

// TODO: [MERNSTACK-11] Delete this schema once it is no longer needed.
